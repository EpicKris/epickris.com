    <p>Working closely with Kristian, there was not a single aspect of his work where he did not exceed expectations. He is that rare developer that has equal abilities in creative design, artistic concepts, technical curiosity, and rigorous methodology. Added to this, Kristian is a thoroughly pleasant person that seems to fit into any team. While he works at all levels, I have seen him at his best gently guiding others in the correct direction. I look forward to seeing whatever he sets his mind to next.</p>
